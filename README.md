## MIT License
New forks should abide the following rules:  
1) Reference *all* original modding teams from which your code has been derived. Do so in all manner of distribution or promotional material, whether at the top or by including a list of credits. Be clear whose shoulders it is that you have built off of. 
2) Alter the 'RichEarth' brand to differentiate between teams (ie: RichEarth Redux, RichEarth XxMeganBlasterxX, etc.) This helps trace mod bloodlines.  

(For reference, see the multiple resource texture packs derived from Soratex and how they brand; or learn this lesson the hard way from how difficult it is to find out who is currently developing the Metallurgy mod...)
